 GPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis. Goodwill assigned to the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units 
 as of January 26, 2020 was $210 million and $408 million, respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments 
 and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each 
 of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently 
 uncertain. 

We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was 
 no goodwill impairment. 
 Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional 
 information.

 GPU Business. GPU business revenue decreased by 7% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, which reflects a decline in GPUs sold 
 for gaming. GeForce GPU product sales for gaming decreased by 10%, reflecting lower sales of GeForce 

                                                                        28

desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional 
visualization increased by 7%, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations. Data Center revenue, which includes Tesla, GRID and 
DGX, increased by 2%, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales. 

Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. This was 
driven by a decline in revenue from SoCs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 9% in Automotive revenue, reflecting 
growth in Al cockpit solutions and development services agreements. 

Concentration of Revenue 
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, 
respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if 
the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. 
Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the GPU business. No customer represented 
10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019. 

Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors 
purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, 
including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component 
costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation 
related to personnel associated with manufacturing. 
Our overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2020 was driven by 
reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components. 
Inventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously 
written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our 
gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019. 
A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: 
  GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by 
  reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components. 
  Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal 
  year 2019.

Research and Development 
Research and development expenses increased by 19% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, driven primarily by employee additions 
and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. 

                                                                         29

 Sales, General and Administrative 
 Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 10% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, driven primarily by employee 
 additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. 

 Total Other Income, Net 
 Interest Income and Interest Expense 
 Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $178 million and $136 million 
 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances. 
 Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes 
 Due 2026 issued in September 2016. Interest expense was $52 million and $58 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

 Other, Net 
 Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and the impact of changes in foreign 
 currency rates. Other, net, was not significant during fiscal year 2020 and was $14 million of income during fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of 
 $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments. 

 Income Taxes 
 We recognized income tax expense of $174 million for fiscal year 2020 and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual 
 effective tax rate was 5.9% and (6.3)% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as 
 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an absence of tax benefits related 
 to the enactment of the TCJA. 

 Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in 
 jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable 
 recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date 
 income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019.

 As of January 26, 2020, we had $10.90 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $3.48 billion from the end of fiscal 
 year 2019. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit 
 exposures, and certain limits on our portfolio duration. 

                                                                         30

Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to changes in working capital driven 
by a reduction in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in operating income. 
Cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to lower purchases, higher sales, and 
lower maturities of marketable securities in preparation for the acquisition of Mellanox. 
Cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to no share repurchases in fiscal year 
2020 and lower tax payments related to employee stock plans. 

Liquidity 
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of 
January 26, 2020, we had $10.90 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our 
operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, including our proposed acquisition of Mellanox. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the United States government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial 
institutions, asset-backed issuers, and foreign government entities. These marketable securities are denominated in United States dollars. Refer to 
Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
During fiscal year 2021, we expect our capital investment to be approximately $700 million to $900 million to fund property and equipment including 
construction of a new building at our Santa Clara campus. 
As a result of the TCJA, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the United States as of January 26, 
2020 are available for use in the United States without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Capital Return to Shareholders 
In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share 
repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not 
repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox. As of January 
26, 2020, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 
2022. 

Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that 
the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. 

Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities 
We have outstanding $1.00 billion of Notes due 2021 and $1.00 billion of Notes due 2026, collectively, the Notes. 
We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan 
commitments up to $425 million. As of January 26, 2020, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement. 
We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 26, 2020, we had not issued any 
commercial paper. 
Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further 
discussion. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
As of January 26, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable SEC regulations. 

                                                                        31
